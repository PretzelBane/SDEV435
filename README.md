# SDEV435
Course Project for SDEV435 (Applied Software Practice)

The goal is to take an output csv file generated by Hubitat Rule Machine and allow some basic analysis to be done.
It's nothing too exciting as it has to fit within the time allotment of the course, but hopefully it'll do some neat things.

I expect to explore and use Tkinter for the GUI and Pandas for data manipulation.
